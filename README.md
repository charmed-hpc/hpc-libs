## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for
development, which provides some useful commands that will help you while hacking on hpc-libs:

```shell
just fmt            # Apply formatting standards to code.
just lint           # Check code against coding style standards.
just typecheck      # Run static type checks.
just unit           # Run unit tests.
```

To run the hpc-libs integration tests, you'll need to have both
[gambol](https://github.com/nuccitheboss/gambol) and [LXD](https://ubuntu.com/lxd) installed
on your machine:

```shell
just integration    # Run integration tests.
```
