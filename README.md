A collection of charm libraries for authoring HPC charms üìñüñãÔ∏è

The hpc-libs charm libraries are used within the [Juju](https://juju.is) charms that compose
Charmed HPC. They are standalone libraries, and should be managed
as charm libraries, with installation via `charmcraft fetch-lib ...`, after which they may be
imported and used as normal Python modules. The current charm libraries in hpc-libs include:

* `is_container` - a library for detecting the virtualization environment the charm is running within.
* `slurm_ops` - a library for managing Slurm cluster operations via snap or systemd.

## ‚ú® Getting Started

Each charm library contains documentation and usage information in its module-level docstring.
Pretty documentation, along with installation instructions, can be viewed on Charmhub:

* [`is_container` documentation](https://charmhub.io/hpc-libs/libraries/is_container)
* [`slurm_ops` documentation](https://charmhub.io/hpc-libs/libraries/slurm_ops)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This project uses [tox](https://tox.wiki) as its command runner, which provides
some useful commands that will help you while hacking on hpc-libs:

```shell
tox run -e fmt     # Apply formatting standards to code.
tox run -e lint    # Check code against coding style standards.
tox run -e static  # Run static type checks.
tox run -e unit    # Run unit tests.
```

To run the hpc-libs integration tests, you'll need to have both
[gambol](https://github.com/nuccitheboss/gambol) and [LXD](https://ubuntu.com/lxd) installed
on your machine:

```shell
tox run -e integration  # Run integration tests.
```
